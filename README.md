# soil-salinity

This project combines California farmland vector data and satellite soil salinity data and displays the result in an interactive web interface.

## Features

- Aggregation function selection (minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation)
- Raster data selection
- Interactive farmland data front-end interface
- Dynamic extents

## Installation

### Dependencies

The soil salinity backend relies upon Java 1.8.0 and Scala 2.12.7.

### Setup

This project expects all data files (shapefile, GeoTIFF) to be stored in the `data/` directory.
The data directory should be organized as follows:

![data directory](doc/images/directory_organization.png)

### Run in development
To run the server in development mode, run the class "`edu.ucr.cs.bdlab.beast.operations.Main`" with command line
argument `server`.

### Server deployment
Place the `data/` on the server at which you want it to be hosted.
Install Beast CLI and run the command `beast server` at the same directory where you have 
the `data` directory (not inside the `data` directory).

### API
Check the detailed [API description here](doc/api.md).

### Add vector dataset
Check the [step-by-step instructions for adding a new vector dataset](doc/add-vector-dataset.md).

# soil-salinity

This project combines California farmland vector data and satellite soil salinity data and displays the result in an interactive web interface.

## Features

- Aggregation function selection (minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation)
- Raster data selection
- Interactive farmland data front-end interface
- Dynamic extents

## Installation

### Dependencies

The soil salinity backend relies upon Java 1.8.0 and Scala 2.12.7.

### Setup

This project expects all data files (shapefile, GeoTIFF) to be stored in the `data/` directory.
The data directory should be organized as follows:

![data directory](doc/images/directory_organization.png)

### Run in development
To run the server in development mode, run the class "`edu.ucr.cs.bdlab.beast.operations.Main`" with command line
argument `server -enableStaticFileHandling`. Open your browser and navigate to
(http://localhost:8890/frontend/index.html).

### Server deployment
Place the `data/` on the server at which you want it to be hosted.
Install Beast CLI and run the following command at the same directory where you have 
the `data` directory (not inside the `data` directory).

```shell
beast --jars futurefarmnow-backend-*.jar server
```

In the directory where you run `beast server`, you can place a file `beast.properties` to set the default
system parameters, e.g., `port`.

**Configure through Apache:** If you want to make the server accessible through Apache, you can add the following
configuration to your Apache web server.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    <Directory /var/www/sites/ffn.cs.ucr.edu/public_html>
        Require all granted
        AllowOverride All
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/futurefarmnow-backend-0.2-SNAPSHOT/(.*)$
        RewriteRule ^futurefarmnow-backend-0.2-SNAPSHOT/(.*)$ http://localhost:8081/$1 [P,L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/futurefarmnow-backend-[\.0-9]*(-[\w\d]+)?/(.*)$
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://localhost:8080/$1 [P,L]
   </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

The first RewriteRule forwards all requests that begin with `/futurefarmnow-backend-0.2-SNAPSHOT/` to the server
running on port 8081. The second rewrite rule forwards requests for any version to the server running on port 8080.
This configuration allows you to deploy a different version of the API while keeping the stable version running.
